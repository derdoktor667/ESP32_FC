# üöÅ ESP32 Flight Controller

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/derdoktor667/ESP32_FC/ci.yml?branch=main&style=for-the-badge) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/derdoktor667/ESP32_FC?style=for-the-badge)

An advanced, high-performance flight controller firmware for quadcopters, built on the ESP32 and the Arduino framework. This project features a highly modular, object-oriented C++ architecture with a clean separation between flight logic and communication.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Maintainable & Extensible API**: The CLI/API command processor has been completely refactored. It now uses a data-driven 'Settings Registry' instead of brittle `if-else` chains. This makes the code cleaner, more robust, and significantly easier to extend with new settings.
*   **Safety-First API Mode**: The API mode now includes a critical safety timeout. If a client disconnects without warning, the firmware automatically returns to flight mode, ensuring the drone does not remain in a non-responsive state.
*   **User-Friendly CLI**: The command-line interface has been significantly improved with a detailed, categorized `help` menu, making it easier than ever to configure and debug the flight controller.
*   **Robust & Reliable Configuration**: Settings management has been completely overhauled. The firmware now reliably loads settings from flash and automatically saves a default configuration on the first boot, ensuring predictable behavior.
*   **Enhanced Code Quality & Reliability**: Significant project-wide cleanup, including removal of unused code, redundant includes, and resolution of a DShot mode persistence bug, leading to a more robust and maintainable codebase.
*   **Clean Modular Architecture**: The firmware is built on two primary components: a `FlightController` class that handles only real-time flight tasks, and a `CommunicationManager` class that manages all serial I/O, providing a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Robust Tri-Mode Serial Interface**: The `CommunicationManager` provides three distinct operating modes for maximum flexibility:
    *   **FLIGHT Mode**: The default, silent mode for normal flight operations.
    *   **API Mode**: A machine-readable JSON interface optimized for programmatic clients and external applications.
    *   **CLI Mode**: A human-readable command-line interface for manual debugging.
*   **High-Performance JSON API**: The `api` mode provides a clean, JSON-only interface. Settings can be fetched with a single `get_settings` command, and a separate, high-frequency `live_data` stream provides real-time attitude and status with minimal overhead.
*   **Stack Overflow Protection**: The firmware intelligently pauses the CPU-intensive flight control pipeline when the API mode is active, dedicating resources to stable communication and preventing crashes.
*   **High-Performance Motor Control**: Employs hardware-accelerated DShot for low-latency, high-resolution communication with ESCs.
*   **Flexible Control System**: Supports interchangeable receiver protocols (i-BUS, PPM) and features **configurable channel mapping**.
*   **Centralized & Persistent Configuration**: All tunable parameters are organized in a single `FlightControllerSettings` struct and are reliably saved to and loaded from flash memory.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the flight controller up and running on your ESP32.

### Prerequisites

*   An ESP32 development board.
*   [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/) installed.
*   All necessary hardware (MPU6050, ESCs, motors, RC receiver) connected according to the pin definitions in `src/config.h`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/derdoktor667/ESP32_FC.git
    cd ESP32_FC
    ```

2.  **Initialize Git Submodules:** This project relies on external libraries managed as submodules. Pull them in with this command:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3.  **Compile and Upload Firmware:** Open the `ESP32_FC.ino` sketch in your Arduino IDE, select your ESP32 board, and upload. Alternatively, use the Arduino CLI:
    ```bash
    arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 ESP32_FC.ino
    arduino-cli upload --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 ESP32_FC.ino
    ```
    *(Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the actual port of your ESP32.)*

## üíª Interface Modes

The firmware boots into a silent `FLIGHT` mode. To interact with it, you must activate one of the two interactive modes.

### API Mode (for Programmatic Clients)

This is the primary mode for programmatic interaction. It ensures clean, machine-readable JSON communication.

1.  **Activation**: Send `api` over the serial connection.
2.  **Response**: The device acknowledges with `{"status":"api_mode_activated"}` and begins streaming `live_data`.

### CLI Mode (for Humans)

This mode is for manual debugging and configuration via a serial monitor.

1.  **Activation**: Connect to the ESP32 with a serial monitor (115200 baud). Type `cli` and press Enter.
2.  **Response**: The CLI activates and presents the `ESP32_FC >` prompt.
