// SetpointManager.cpp
//
// This file implements the SetpointManager class, which is responsible for
// translating raw receiver inputs into desired flight setpoints (roll, pitch, yaw)
// based on the current flight mode. It scales and maps stick movements to
// appropriate control targets for the PID controllers.
